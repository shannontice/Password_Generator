# Password_Generator
## Description

In this project we took exsiting code and used JavaScript to create a random password generator that allows the user to interact with the browse. The prompts allow the user to input whether they want the generated password to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters. A pop-up has also been created with Javascript so the number of characters desired can be entered.
